# Introduction

This material has been developed as a solution to the peer-graded exercise for the September-November session of ["Introduction to Mathematical Thinking"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking") by [Prof. Keith Devlin](http://profkeithdevlin.com/ "Prof. Keith Devlin") course available on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com "Coursera").

During the peer-graded review I received some supportive feedback (the grade was 93\%) and some of the fellow students asked about how the material was created. Therefore I decided to publish the work, as an example for further use.

Note that the reader of this material must not use nor present the content of this material as being their own work (in other words, you must obey [Coursera's honor code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code "Coursera's honor code")). The _content_ (the proofs themselves) should be used just as an inspiration on how to do your own work (beware that I am not a mathematician, so my approach in some cases might not be the correct one - so use at your own risk!).

However, the _template_ (the LaTeX file) can be used even for commercial purpose being released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/themeshter/learn/blob/master/LICENSE "MIT license").


# Editorial Notes
This material was created using the following tools:

*   **Operating system**: [Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus) x64 Desktop Edition](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ "Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus) x64 Desktop Edition").
*   **LaTeX editor**: Texmaker version 4.4.1.
*	**LaTeX~toolset**: Texlive.

There are no links provided to Texmaker or Texlive because you can install those from Ubuntu's distribution.

In order to start your work, follow these steps:
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `main.tex` file with Texmaker.
3.	Start editing it and change it to whatever you want. The `F1` key will "build" your PDF.

## Support
If you run into any trouble with producing your PDF:

*   Get help from yourself ;-). By saying that I mean just look online help ("google it", colloquially speaking) before asking somebody else. You will be surprised how many problems you can actually solve by yourself with no external help at all.
*   If the step above doesn't work, call a friend - somebody you know that has experience with LaTeX. I am not a LaTeX expert, but with online help I usually get to where I want to go...
*	As a last resort, you can open an issues here and I will try to respond when I will have some time (answering is not guaranteed though).
