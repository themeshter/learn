# In a nutshell...
This is a repository with small items I have gathered while learning (primarily MOOCs but other goodies can be found here as well).  
# MOOCs
Here is a list of massive open online courses I took over time and some useful material about them:
## Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
The course is available through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/ "Coursera") at [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking"). The course if provided by [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu "Stanford University") and is thought by [Dr. Keith Devlin](http://profkeithdevlin.com/ "Dr. Keith Devlin").
